# Vardiel skill

Use Vardiel when evidence is required from DNS, HTTP, TLS, a trusted local Docker Engine, a Kubernetes cluster configured with least-privilege credentials, or trusted Prometheus and Loki endpoints. Treat its JSON output as evidence and preserve uncertainty.

> Current capability: read-only, request-driven diagnostics. The accepted
> product direction adds an always-on local Linux recovery daemon, but that
> daemon, standing policy, fixed actions, automatic recovery, and notification
> behavior are not implemented yet. Do not claim that Vardiel repaired a host
> unless a future action result and independent validation explicitly prove it.

## Preferred integration: MCP

Configure the Vardiel binary as a stdio MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vardiel": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/vardiel",
      "args": ["mcp", "stdio"],
      "env": {
        "VARDIEL_DOCKER_SOCKET": "/var/run/docker.sock",
        "VARDIEL_KUBECONFIG": "/absolute/path/to/kubeconfig",
        "VARDIEL_KUBERNETES_CONTEXT": "production-readonly",
        "VARDIEL_PROMETHEUS_URL": "https://prometheus.example.com",
        "VARDIEL_PROMETHEUS_BEARER_TOKEN_FILE": "/absolute/path/to/prometheus-token",
        "VARDIEL_LOKI_URL": "https://loki.example.com",
        "VARDIEL_LOKI_BEARER_TOKEN_FILE": "/absolute/path/to/loki-token",
        "VARDIEL_LOKI_TENANT_ID": "operations"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Discover and invoke the published tools through the MCP client. The tools are read-only and idempotent, but network, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Loki tools still interact with privileged external systems. Do not grant these capabilities unless the runtime is trusted.

Use `tls_inspect` when certificate expiry, trust, hostname coverage, TLS versions, cipher suites, or handshake failures may explain an incident. A successful handshake does not imply certificate verification succeeded: always inspect `verified` and `verification_error`.

For Docker incidents:

1. Call `docker_engine_info` to verify Engine connectivity and host-level runtime capabilities.
2. Call `docker_container_list` to identify stopped, restarting, unhealthy, or unexpectedly exposed containers.
3. Call `docker_container_inspect` only for the relevant container.

The Docker inspect result is intentionally incomplete. `warning_count` and `error_present` indicate that additional human investigation may be needed, but raw warning/error text, environment values, commands, labels, health output, log paths, and host mount source paths are not returned.

For Kubernetes incidents:

1. Call `kubernetes_cluster_info` to verify API connectivity, server version, node readiness, scheduling state, capacity, and node conditions.
2. Call `kubernetes_pod_list` for the relevant namespace. Use `*` only when a cluster-wide view is necessary.
3. Prioritize Pods that are not Ready, have high restart counts, are Pending/Failed, or report abnormal status reasons.
4. Call `kubernetes_pod_inspect` only for the relevant Pod.
5. Interpret Event `type` and `reason` patterns such as `FailedScheduling`, `BackOff`, `Unhealthy`, or `FailedMount`. Event messages and Pod/container free-text messages are intentionally absent.

Do not infer that an omitted field is empty. Pod logs, environment values, commands, arguments, labels, annotations, Secret/ConfigMap references, volume sources, and free-text messages are not collected. When `events_truncated` is true, state that the event sample was bounded.

For Prometheus incidents:

1. Call `prometheus_server_info` to verify connectivity, version, reload status, retention, series count, corruption count, and runtime pressure.
2. Call `prometheus_target_list` to identify down or unhealthy scrape targets. `error_present` indicates an omitted target error message.
3. Call `prometheus_metric_snapshot` only for a known metric relevant to the hypothesis.
4. Prefer exact matchers such as `job`, `namespace`, `pod`, `container`, `node`, or `instance` to narrow the result.
5. Use a safe aggregation only when the raw series view is not required. State when `truncated` is true.

`prometheus_metric_snapshot` does not accept arbitrary PromQL. Functions, range vectors, regular expressions, subqueries, offsets, arbitrary label names, scrape URLs, discovered labels, raw target errors, warning/info text, runtime hostname, working directory, and credentials are intentionally unavailable.

For Loki incidents:

1. Call `loki_server_info` to verify readiness and build version.
2. Call `loki_stream_summary` with at least one exact diagnostic matcher such as `namespace`, `service_name`, `app`, `pod`, or `container`.
3. Keep lookback narrow and increase it only when the expected stream is absent.
4. Treat returned items as stream existence evidence, not log evidence. State when `truncated` is true.

`loki_stream_summary` does not return log lines and does not accept arbitrary LogQL, regular expressions, empty selectors, query/query-range, tail, label enumeration, arbitrary paths, or write operations. Unknown stream labels, filenames, arbitrary metadata, readiness bodies, and credentials are intentionally unavailable.

## Delegate a diagnostic task

```bash
vardiel agent run 'Check Kubernetes Pods, Prometheus targets, and Loki stream availability.'
```

This requires `ARK_MODEL_ID` and Ark credentials in the process environment. The command writes JSON containing the final answer, message history, and step count to stdout.

For live progress without mixing events into the final result:

```bash
vardiel agent run --events=jsonl 'Inspect example.com.' 2>events.jsonl
```

Consume stderr as a JSONL event stream and stdout as the final result. Events contain lifecycle metadata only; they do not contain prompts, tool arguments, tool results, or credentials.

## Discover tools without MCP

```bash
vardiel tool list
```

## Run a tool directly

```bash
vardiel tool run dns_lookup '{"host":"example.com"}'
vardiel tool run http_probe '{"url":"https://example.com"}'
vardiel tool run tls_inspect '{"host":"example.com","port":443}'
vardiel tool run docker_engine_info '{}'
vardiel tool run docker_container_list '{"all":true,"limit":100}'
vardiel tool run docker_container_inspect '{"container":"web"}'
vardiel tool run kubernetes_cluster_info '{"node_limit":100}'
vardiel tool run kubernetes_pod_list '{"namespace":"operations","limit":100}'
vardiel tool run kubernetes_pod_inspect '{"namespace":"operations","pod":"web-0","event_limit":50}'
vardiel tool run prometheus_server_info '{}'
vardiel tool run prometheus_target_list '{"limit":100}'
vardiel tool run prometheus_metric_snapshot '{"metric":"up","matchers":{"job":"node"},"aggregation":"sum","group_by":["instance"],"limit":100}'
vardiel tool run loki_server_info '{}'
vardiel tool run loki_stream_summary '{"matchers":{"namespace":"operations","service_name":"api"},"lookback_minutes":60,"limit":100}'
```

Check `ok` before reading `data`. Do not enable private-network HTTP/TLS, Prometheus HTTP, or Loki HTTP outside a trusted environment. Docker sockets, Kubernetes credentials, Prometheus credentials, Loki credentials, and Loki tenant identities must be least-privilege and scoped to the configured endpoint.

Do not fabricate tool results. Preserve returned error classes and continue with other read-only evidence when possible. Never expose Ark credentials, kubeconfig contents, ServiceAccount tokens, Prometheus or Loki bearer tokens, tenant credentials, or raw infrastructure credentials in prompts, logs, or tool arguments. In MCP mode, treat stdout as protocol-only and send diagnostics to stderr.

## Roadmap boundary

ADR 0002 makes fast autonomous Linux recovery the product goal. The first
planned slice is one allowlisted systemd service with event-driven detection,
explicit standing authorization, a fixed restart action, health validation,
cooldown/circuit breaking, sanitized audit, and quiet success. Known recovery
must not require a model call.

The roadmap's core incident families are error troubleshooting, environment
failure recovery, and deployment troubleshooting. Planned operations manuals,
known-error remedies, and deployment runbooks are versioned advisory knowledge;
they cannot define an operation or grant authority. Semantic or vector retrieval
is deferred until deterministic local matching has a measured recall gap.

Until that implementation is merged, external agents must treat every current
Vardiel tool as read-only. They must not synthesize shell commands, infer policy,
or turn current observation results into an unapproved mutation.
